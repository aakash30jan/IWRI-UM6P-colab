Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability - remember there are no right or wrong answers :    
1. In less than 100 words explain the ESRGAN article   
2. From the Python exercise where you evaluated the performance of the model, what could be the 3 reasons for the bad accuracy of the predicted image from the model when compared with the original image?    
3. How would you improve the accuracy of the existing model? Answer in 3 short points.    
4. What are PSNR, MSE, and SSIM from the compare_images function in helpers_ESRGAN.py? Explain each in one sentence.    
5. Do you know of any latest models for super-resolution published in 2023 ?
